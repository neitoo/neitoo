<h2>Hi, I'm Nikita — a frontend developer who occasionally touches the backend<br>
(and once wrestled with Kotlin, Compose, and Firebase — they haunt me still).</h2>

    💡 Clean UI is my love language  
    🔧 React + TypeScript + Vite — is my weapon of choice  
    🧩 HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind, and the occasional Vanilla JS magic  
    🎨 CSS Modules, responsive layouts, pixel-perfect design — all part of the game  
    🛠️ I care about structure, semantics, and user experience  
    📦 I’ve dabbled in backend with Node.js and PostgreSQL  
    📱 Used to build Android apps with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose  
    🧠 Still remembers what MVVM stands for  
    🌊 Sometimes I even remember to drink water

  > I build web apps that are pleasant to look at and nice to use.<br>
  > I enjoy bringing order to interfaces — and to the code behind them.<br>
  > Shipping pixels, avoiding burnout, and always ready to ctrl+z my mistakes.
